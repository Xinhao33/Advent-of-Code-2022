## Day1

simmple, but for day1_2 we can still discuss about the complexity.

method 1: we can firstly sort the list sum, then sum up the three first value, in theory we can have a complexity nlogn,

method 2: we can find the biggest sum, then delete this sum, do it 3 times. in this way we have a complexity 3n.

In this exercise, we have a list sum which contains 266 element, log266 ==7.7548875021635, so it's better to choose methode 2.
